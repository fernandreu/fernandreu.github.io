### Extract the numeric coordinates of a two-dimensional graph in image format

Once the axes of the graph are defined, the program will translate screen coordinates into graph
coordinates. The axes can also be be logarithmic.

The points can be easily copied into the clipboard and pasted in other programs, such as text files or
spreadsheets. The program also supports graphs that are not perfectly square (e.g. from an angled
photograph).
